# Requirements for running on top of indigo

# trusty packages versions to validate behavior with these versions for a potential ROS package for rostful
# pytest==2.5.1
# pytest-xdist==1.8  # for --boxed
# hypothesis==3.0.1  # backported to indigo as https://github.com/asmodehn/hypothesis-rosrelease
# numpy>=1.8.1
# TESTS are outside the package : they dont need to match the system packages on the corresponding ROS DISTRO
# since they willnot be distributed as part of the package.


# Package Dependencies need to match ROS (or trusty's) package version

tblib==1.2.0  # this might not always install six (latest version does not)
# six==1.5.2  # dropping six here, our usage is minimal and it breaks test tools
pyzmq==14.0.1
pyzmp==0.0.17
pyros_config==0.2.0
pyros_common==0.5.1
#pyros_interfaces_ros==0.4.0  # TODO : follow up on what packages from ROS are needed as pure python to test this...
mock==1.0.1
